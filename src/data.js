      "I visited New Hamsphire as a solo trip for the first time since becoming a mom. I went to visit a friend for almost 10 days. We drove around the area, heading up to North Conway and down to Boston. It was extremely cold and snowy, and much more expensive than I thought it would be, but overall, a great trip and met some lovely people.",

      "We went to Dublin with the intention of potentially moving there. I loved how the streets seemed old yet trendy at the same time. Irish people were extremely friendly. Eating out was expensive but overall it felt like an affordable and decent place to live, with exception maybe to the rain.",
